# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Data-Analysis-in-Excel
## Project Objective 
To design a dynamic and interactive Excel dashboard that enables hospital administrators to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as patient inflow, department efficiency, bed occupancy, and discharge trends. This dashboard helps in quick decision-making and operational management by visualizing hospital data effectively.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/DivyaHS26/Hospital-Emergency-Room-Data-Analysis-in-Excel/blob/main/Hospital%20Dashboard%20Final.xlsx">Hospital DataSet</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the total number of patients treated?
- How do patient admissions vary month-wise?
- Which departments have the highest patient counts?
- What is the gender distribution of patients?
- How do admission and discharge numbers compare?
- What is the ratio of in-patients to out-patients?
- Which departments are performing most efficiently?
- What is the monthly bed occupancy rate?

## Project Scope
The scope of this project is to design a dynamic and interactive Excel dashboard that provides a visual summary of hospital operations. It covers patient demographics, department-wise analysis, monthly trends, and key performance indicators such as total admissions, discharges, and occupancy. The dashboard is intended for use by hospital administrators to monitor performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions—using only Excel tools like pivot tables, slicers, charts, and conditional formatting.

## Process
Data Collection: Imported patient and hospital operational data into Excel.
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.
Data Modeling: Organized data into structured tables and created meaningful relationships.
Dashboard Design:
Used Pivot Tables for aggregation.
Integrated Slicers for interactivity (e.g., department, month).
Created Charts (bar, line, pie) for visual storytelling.
Finalization: Applied formatting, titles, legends, and filters for usability.

## Project Insight
The Emergency Department handles the highest patient load throughout the year.
Bed occupancy peaks during certain months, indicating seasonal demand.
A visible gap was found between admissions and discharges, pointing to potential bottlenecks.
The dashboard helped highlight underperforming departments requiring staff reallocation or review.

## Final Conclusion
The Excel-based Hospital Dashboard provides a centralized view of the hospital’s operational performance. By using interactive visuals and key metrics, it empowers stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, optimize resource usage, and improve patient care efficiency. This project demonstrates how powerful insights can be derived from structured data using Excel tools alone.
